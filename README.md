## 🎨 Key Features
* **Project-Based Categorization:** Create custom projects (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Gym") to keep tasks organized and focused.
* **Full CRUD Functionality:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete both individual tasks and entire projects.
* **Priority & Due Dates:** Color-coded priority levels and date integration using the `date-fns` library for better time management.
* **Persistent Storage:** (Optional) Integrated `localStorage` to ensure your data survives a page refresh.
* **Dynamic Content Loading:** A "Single Page Application" feel where switching projects re-renders the task list instantly.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
* **ES6 Classes & Factories:** Utilized object-oriented principles to create `Todo` and `Project` instances.
* **Module Pattern:** Decoupled application logic (data handling) from DOM manipulation using ES6 modules.
* **NPM Integration:** Leveraged external libraries like `date-fns` for robust date formatting and manipulation.
* **Webpack Bundling:** Optimized the development workflow with a custom Webpack configuration for assets and scripts.
